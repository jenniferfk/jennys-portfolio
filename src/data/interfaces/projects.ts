The user also has access to sports and health news to stay updated on every topic related to them. The news in this app is global news because the API returns so, but the idea out of it would be sports/ health news. Additionally, the user can log the food he consumed during his day and the calories will be added for the user to see."

    description:"The idea of my app is to be able to write text posts just like old twitter. My main idea was cloning twitter, but to do so I must have a bigger Api than I already have. To be able to add to favorites, or post a story or comment, I need more resources than I already have in my mock Api, so I decided to create a new app with a new name and new design. Not a complex app, but straight to the requirements. I didn’t want to add features that don’t work just for the sake of the cloning, so it resulted in a non-complex app."
